    Announce: Niecza Perl 6 v11

This is the eleventh release of Niecza Perl 6, as usual scheduled on
the last Monday of the month, at least in the US west coast time zone.

You can obtain a build of Niecza from [1].  This build contains a
working compiler as a set of .exe and .dll files suitable for use with
Mono or Microsoft .NET.  If you wish to follow latest developments,
you can obtain the source from [2]; however, you will still need a
binary for bootstrapping, so you gain nothing from a "source is
better" perspective.

Niecza is a Perl 6 compiler project studying questions about the
efficient implementability of Perl 6 features.  It currently targets
the Common Language Runtime; both Mono and Microsoft .NET are known to
work.  On Windows, Cygwin is required for source builds only; see the
README for details.


    List of changes


[Major features / Breaking changes]

The compile time / runtime metamodel unification mentioned in the v10
announce is done now.  Real Sub and ClassHOW objects are created at
compile time and stored in a .ser (serialized data) file alongside the
.dll.  When using modules the .ser file is loaded; .nam files are gone.
Some operations are faster and others are slower.

All non-dotnet backends no longer work and have been removed, since
niecza now requires much closer integration between the front and back
ends.  Restoring them would not be impossible.

BEGIN time code execution is now supported!  In particular, a BEGIN in
a module is run *once*; any objects it creates will be serialized, and
the BEGIN is not re-run at runtime.  It is erroneous to modify objects
owned by a different module at BEGIN time.


[Minor new features]

The x*+ syntax is now supported as a synonym of x**, doing possessive
quantification like Perl 5.

"make spectest" now respects TEST_JOBS.  (Will Coleda)

todo is now supported in tests.

Various improvemends to the p5 interop system. (Pawe≈Ç Murias)

CLR interop example improvements: make clock resizable, add notepad,
tetris, webbrowser. (Martin Berends)

Fleshed out TextWriter and open to some semblance of usability.
Added close, unlink, mkdir. (Solomon Foster)

Added .pick and .roll. (Solomon Foster)

Added log, log10, exp, cis, polar, gcd, lcm. (Solomon Foster)

Handling of variable types that are constrained to Mu but default to
Any are more consistant.

[Selected bug fixes]

grep /regex/, @list no longer crashes.

" (a source file with an unclosed string) no longer crashes the compiler.


    Getting involved

Contact sorear in irc.freenode.net #perl6 or via the sender address of
this mailing.  Also check out the TODO file; whether you want to work
on stuff on it, or have cool ideas to add to it, both are good.

    Future directions

In the wake of the /serialize branch merge there will be a lot of
bugs to fix and documents to update.  I am also looking at designing
a good practical realization of S11 and module packaging.
