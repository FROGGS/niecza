=head1 ABOUT

This is 'Niecza', which will eventually be a Perl 6 implementation focusing
on optimization research.  It targets the Common Language Runtime (ECMA-335;
implementations are "Mono" and ".NET").

It's currently very primitive; Hello, World is close to its limits.

This project is a spin-off of experiments done for Matthew "diakopter" Wilson's
csmeta / Sprixel project, and is heavily inspired by many of its lower-level
details.
