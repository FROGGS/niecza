* Generally speaking, the setting is very incomplete.  Patches to add
  methods or subs to the setting, with tests, are welcome.
  - Series operators, stuff like that.
  - split, trans; a lot of basic Str/Num operators are missing
  - Beware - multiple dispatch is NYI!

* Control structures still have a lot of unimplemented cases.  loop
  should be pretty straightforward, for instance.

* In particular, I/O is sorely lacking.
  - $*ARGFILES
  - open/read/write/close
  - dir
  - IO::Socket
  - Buf stuff
  - %*ENV

* If you want to add base functionality like CATCH blocks, talk to me
  first; I have plans on these.  I don't think there are terribly many
  of this sort left though.

* Contributions for perf/ are welcome and will be treated as challenges.

* If you have Microsoft .NET, I'd like Niecza to work out of the box.
  That means a little bit of logic to probe for it, and then adapting
  CompilerDriver to invoke csc instead of gmcs.  Also niecza_eval
  should run .exe files directly instead of "mono foo.exe".
