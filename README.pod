=head1 ABOUT

This is 'Niecza', which will eventually be a Perl 6 implementation focusing
on optimization research.  It targets the Common Language Runtime (ECMA-335;
implementations are "Mono" and ".NET"). 

There is also a Common Lisp backend in the works.

To see the current state of the art, the best documentation is the testsuite,
C<test.pl>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES (RUNTIME)

=over 4

=item *

To run on Mono: You will need 2.8.x or higher.  2.8.2 or later is
recommended for best performance; you should use C<RUN_CLR=mono-sgen>
in this case.  2.10 (latest stable) is also tested.

To run on Windows/Mono (2.8.2 and 2.10) and other systems, download the
mono installers from C<http://go-mono.org/>

=item *

To run on Windows/Microsoft .NET 3.5 (2.0 runtime with 3.5 extensions)
or .NET 4.0, install the .NET runtime from C<http://goo.gl/PMKvB>

Notes: The first time the compiler is run, the setting must be compiled,
which adds about a minute on most hardware to the runtime.  The second
run will be much faster.  Also, the recompilation checker is not robust
to file format changes; it may be necessary to clean temporary files
after updates.

Building on Windows currently requires the Cygwin environment with Mono's
gmcs.exe in your Cygwin shell's $PATH, though in principle .NET's csc.exe
could be made to work eventually, if it doesn't already.

This project was originally a spin-off of experiments done for
Matthew "diakopter" Wilson's sprixel project, and was heavily inspired by
many of its lower-level details.
