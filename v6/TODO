These things were noticed during translation, but to fix them now would
only slow me down...

* sprintf, in particular, the ability to make numbers hex
* hash initialization idioms don't work
* no qw< >
* Any strificatrion/numification warnings would be useful
* no is rw on attributes and methods
* &split
* &callsame
* BUILD
* given/when
* non-$ attributes; @.foo and @<foo>
* :$.foo is broken
* eager map optimizations
* return()
* stashes should be accessed as common values
* "Action method ::($name) not implemented" bug
* context accelerators need to robustly handle undefined objects
* .list, item as accelerated contexts
* explicitly imprecise error reporting - lines A-B
* @PROCESS::ARGS ::= [1,2,3]; ok +[ @*ARGS ] == 3 # Bug
