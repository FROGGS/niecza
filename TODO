From the v6/TODO:
These things were noticed during translation, but to fix them now would
only slow me down...

* sprintf, in particular, the ability to make numbers hex
* hash initialization idioms don't work
* no qw< >
* Any strificatrion/numification warnings would be useful
* no is rw on attributes and methods
* &split
* &callsame
* BUILD
* given/when
* non-$ attributes; @.foo and @<foo>
* :$.foo is broken
* return()
* stashes should be accessed as common values
* "Action method ::($name) not implemented", also needs $<sym>
* context accelerators need to robustly handle undefined objects
* explicitly imprecise error reporting - lines A-B
* @PROCESS::ARGS ::= [1,2,3]; ok +[ @*ARGS ] == 3 # Bug
* Whatever-currying of prefixes my $x = ~*; say $x() # Whatever()<instance>

Other stuff
    * Write a ROADMAP
    * Flesh out documentation a lot

For STD difference minimization:
    * Find a compromise on :$*endsym
        - TimToady and I seem to both not hate traits
    * Find a compromise on cursor mutability
    * basic multimethods
    * s///
    * given / when
    * constant %foo = (a => 1, b => 2)
